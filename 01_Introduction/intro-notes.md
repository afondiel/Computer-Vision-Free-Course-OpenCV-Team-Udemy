# Introduction

## Introduction notes by Dr. Sataya Mallick, CEO of OpenCV

```
Hello, everybody, I'm Sataya Mallick, and I'm thrilled to help you get started with open TV built over

20 years, open TV is the most extensive computer vision library in the world.

It is downloaded between one to two million times a week, and it contains over 2500 optimized algorithms

to build computer vision and applications.

Open is the first library you need to learn.

Welcome to the three getting started CV's.

We designed it for absolute beginners.

All you need is an intermediate level of programming knowledge and Python Auburn CV is vast.

It is not possible to cover all aspects of the library in the short period of time.

This series is your first step.

It will help you get started.

The material in the series will be covered using Jupyter notebooks.

We will go over every notebook in a video to help you understand the code.

The first few notebooks are all about basics.

What are images and videos?

How do we represent them inside open?

What OpenSea functions do we use to read, write and manipulate photos and videos?

Next, we will go over image enhancement and filtering.

Our objective in this series is also to give you a glimpse into applications you can build using open

CV functions.

You will go over different image transformations and show you how to align to images.

The same idea can be modified slightly to create beautiful panoramas.

Open CV also implements many classical machine learning algorithms and has an entire module dedicated

to deep learning in France.

We will learn how to implement face detection and object tracking.

Finally, we will wrap up the series by learning how to use deep learning module for object detection

and pose estimation.

It's going to be very interesting.

That's all we will cover in this Getting Started series, and after completing this series, I encourage

you to go and take a look at the free content at Open Seaborg and learn OpenSea VidCon and when you're

ready for structured learning and you're seeking mastery and computer vision and E-I.

Check out our courses at Auburn City dot org slash courses.

I wish you all the best in your learning path.

Thank you.
